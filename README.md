# GHCN Precipitation Totals
NOAAâ€™s Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) collects climate summaries from thousands of weather stations around the globe. Two GHCN data sets, GHCN-D and GHCN-M are publicly available on Google BigQuery. The GHCN-D data set summarizes observed conditons by day, while GHCN-M provides summarized obsevations by month. Descriptions for both the daily and monthly data sets are available through NOAA's website. 

In the Jupyter notebook `ghcn_precipitation`, precipitation totals near a given landmark are explored using the GHCN-D data set.
